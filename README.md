# Laravel Cookie Consent

This package currently work in progress.

The package provides the views and controllers necessary to display a fixed message at the bottom of the window, prompting the user to accept the cookies or configure them.

If the user chooses to configure the cookies a modal will be displayed listing all types of cookies the website uses, allowing to disable or enable certain types. Once his preferences are saved a button is displayed enabling the user to configure his preferences.

The views are styled with tailwindcss and alpinejs leverages the rest, so these are prerequisite in your Laravel project.

Once the preferences are saved, you can check in your views if a certain type of cookies is allowed like this: 

```blade
@if(session('cookie-config.Functional')) 
    //Your code, maybe a Google Analytics tag 
@endif
```

Where 'Functional' is the type you specify in the config file.

## Installation

This package is intended for use in existing Laravel projects using Tailwindcss and AlpineJS. 

You can install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require pascalkrieger/laravel-cookie-consent
```

Tailwindcss and AlpineJS should be installed, if not install them following the instructions in their documentation.

For Tailwindcss visit:  https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/laravel

For AlpineJS visit: https://alpinejs.dev/essentials/installation

Publish the views running: 

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Pascalkrieger\LaravelCookieConsent\LaravelCookieConsentServiceProvider" --tag="laravel-cookie-consent-views"
```

Then run: 

```bash
npm run build
```

## Usage

Include the blade component at the bottom of your page or layout: 

```blade
    <x-laravel-cookie-consent::index /> 
```

You should publish and edit the config file, run this command:

```bash
    php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Pascalkrieger\LaravelCookieConsent\LaravelCookieConsentServiceProvider" --tag="laravel-cookie-consent-config"
```

The code is pretty basic and self explanatory. As stated before this is work in progress, in use right now in some of my other projects. YouÂ´re welcome to use it as you wish.
